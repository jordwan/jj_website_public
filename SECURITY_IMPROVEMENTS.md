# Security Improvements Summary

## Critical Security Fixes Applied

### 1. Private Key Exposure (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: Private keys were exposed through `REACT_APP_` environment variables in `hardhat.config.js`, which get bundled into client-side code.
**Fix**: 
- Removed `REACT_APP_` prefix from all sensitive environment variables
- Created `.env.example` file with proper documentation
- Updated to use server-side only env vars: `PRIVATE_KEY`, `GOERLI_URL`, `ETHERSCAN_KEY`

### 2. Smart Contract Reentrancy Vulnerability (HIGH)
**Issue**: The `withdraw()` function was vulnerable to reentrancy attacks
**Fix**:
- Added OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` 
- Applied `nonReentrant` modifier to `withdraw()` and `mint()` functions
- Implemented checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Used low-level `call` instead of `transfer` for better gas handling

### 3. Dependency Vulnerabilities (HIGH)
**Issue**: 52 npm vulnerabilities (20 high, 2 critical)
**Fix**:
- Updated `@openzeppelin/contracts` from 4.8.0 to 5.1.0
- Run `npm install` to update dependencies

### 4. Input Validation (MEDIUM)
**Issue**: No validation on mint amounts in frontend
**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive input validation in `handleMint()`
- Added loading states and user-friendly error messages
- Validates mint amount is between 1-3
- Proper error handling for various failure scenarios

### 5. Code Quality Issues (LOW)
**Issue**: Incorrect import statements
**Fix**: 
- Fixed incorrect `Link` import in `NavBar.js`
- Replaced with standard anchor tags

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to update all dependencies
2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add your private keys
3. Re-deploy the smart contract with the security fixes
4. Update `REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `.env` with new contract address
5. Consider adding:
   - Rate limiting for minting
   - Merkle tree for allowlist/presale
   - Pausable functionality for emergencies
   - Additional monitoring and logging

## Important Notes

- NEVER commit `.env` file to version control
- Always use `REACT_APP_` prefix ONLY for non-sensitive data that's safe to expose
- Regularly audit dependencies with `npm audit`
- Consider using a hardware wallet or multi-sig for contract ownership
